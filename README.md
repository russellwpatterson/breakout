# Breakout
A simple JS Breakout game I wrote for my visit to FHHS in 2017.

Live demo [here](https://russellwpatterson.github.io/breakout/)

It doesn't do lives or anything particularly fancy like that. Just bounces a ball at some blocks. I'd describe it as "poorly written". All kinds of things that I shouldn't have done that I did anyway just to get something together quickly.

It's a little buggy too, but whatever.
